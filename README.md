> Udacity Nanodegree - Front End Web Developer Project

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get up running this project.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/volcain-io/fewd-feedreader.git
cd fewd-feedreader/
```

Open 'index.html' with your favourite web browser and take a look at the bottom of the page to see the Jasmine test results.
